# Practices to continue
* Continue to discuss during our daily standups
   * Discuss what we have finished, what we’re currently working on, and any problems we had during the sprint.
* Continue to work together on reviewing pull requests
   * Allows us to test the code by other members before merging regardless of no branch conflicts.
* Look up some modern UI design guides and examples to help us design a better looking UI
* Fully prototype the UI in Figma so we know exactly how it will look and feel before implementing
* Have backend work on some frontend components, namely API related stuff, to lessen the load on frontend

# Best/worst experiences during sprint 3
* Best:
   * Able to work together and set goals daily.
   * Managed to have a consistent meeting on every mandatory day.
   * Communicated necessary changes between frontend and backend
* Worst:
   * Weren’t able to efficiently finish user stories
      * Felt slow when discussing the same user stories for multiple days
   * Issues with connecting front and back end: CORS errors, cookies, authentication and tracking, etc.
   * Bad/Unbalanced distribution of work (Frontend had much more features to create/make compared to backend features)
